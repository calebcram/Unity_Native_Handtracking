# Unity Hand Tracking
 This is a simple project with a barebones hand tracking visualization setup using the native Unity API. This project is set up for deployment to the HoloLens 2 and the Quest (1, 2 & Pro) via the respective Universal Windows and the Android platforms respectively.

Shoutout to Joost van Schaik for his blogpost documenting the process for getting Unity XR hands to work on HoloLens and Quest in a bare bones project, I've linked to his original [repository here](https://localjoost.github.io/Getting-Unity-XR-hands-to-work-on-HoloLens-and-Quest-in-a-bare-bones-project/).
